## App Description

### Promotional Text (170 characters max)

Your invisible fitness coach. The Ghost watches, learns, and protects your training time—scheduling workouts around your life, not the other way around.

### Description (4000 characters max)

**The Ghost doesn't nag. It doesn't motivate. It just makes training happen.**

Unlike every other fitness app that demands your attention with notifications, badges, and reminders, The Ghost works invisibly in the background. It learns your patterns, watches your calendar, monitors your recovery, and schedules training blocks when you're most likely to actually complete them.

**INVISIBLE BY DESIGN**

• Silent operation - no constant pings or motivational quotes
• Learns your patterns over weeks, not days
• Schedules around your real calendar (work, family, life)
• Adapts when conflicts arise without asking

**THE TRUST SYSTEM**

The Ghost earns autonomy through demonstrated competence:

→ **Observer Phase**: Just watching, learning your patterns
→ **Scheduler Phase**: Suggesting optimal workout times
→ **Auto-Scheduler Phase**: Placing workouts on your calendar
→ **Transformer Phase**: Moving workouts when conflicts arise
→ **Full Ghost Mode**: Complete autonomous scheduling

You always have final say. Delete a scheduled workout? Ghost notices. Miss too many? It backs off. Complete them consistently? It earns more autonomy.

**RECOVERY-AWARE SCHEDULING**

The Ghost integrates with Apple Health to understand your recovery:

• Sleep quality and duration
• Heart rate variability (HRV) trends
• Resting heart rate patterns
• Workout history and intensity

Poor recovery? Ghost automatically adjusts—swapping HIIT for mobility, or rescheduling entirely.

**CALENDAR INTELLIGENCE**

• Reads ALL your calendars to find real availability
• Respects your "sacred times" (family dinner, kids' activities)
• Optional: Blocks "Busy" on your work calendar to protect training time
• Detects patterns (every Tuesday lunch? Ghost knows)

**WEEKLY VALUE RECEIPT**

Every Sunday, see exactly what The Ghost did for you:
• Workouts scheduled and completed
• Conflicts detected and resolved
• Time saved from manual planning
• Trust progression

**APPLE WATCH COMPANION**

Your Watch becomes the Ghost's eyes and ears:
• Records workouts with heart rate
• Shows today's scheduled block
• Trust level indicator
• Silent taps for workout reminders

**PRIVACY FIRST**

• Health data stays on device (Core Data + CloudKit)
• Calendar data read-only (except Vigor Training calendar)
• No ads, no data selling, no tracking
• Optional cloud sync for your own backup

---

The Ghost represents a new philosophy in fitness technology: invisible assistance that respects your time, learns your patterns, and earns your trust through demonstrated reliability.

Stop managing your fitness app. Let it manage itself.

## Review Notes

### Demo Account

Not required - app works with local data after onboarding.

### Notes for Reviewer

- HealthKit access is requested during onboarding for recovery-aware scheduling
- Calendar access is required for core functionality
- Background App Refresh is required for the Ghost's invisible operation
- Silent push notifications wake the app for morning/evening cycles
- Watch app is optional but enhances experience

The Ghost is designed to be "invisible" - it works best when the user forgets it's there. The trust system ensures the app never oversteps, and users always maintain control.
