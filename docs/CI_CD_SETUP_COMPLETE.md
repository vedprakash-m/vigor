# üöÄ CI/CD Setup Complete!

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Azure Infrastructure Ready

- ‚úÖ Service Principal created for GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ Terraform state storage configured (`vigor-tfstate-rg`)
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline ready in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### 2. Generated Secure Credentials

All the necessary passwords and keys have been generated. **Check your terminal output above** for the actual values.

## üîë Next Step: Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to: https://github.com/vedprakash-m/vigor/settings/secrets/actions

### Required Secrets (copy values from terminal output):

```
AZURE_CREDENTIALS
TFSTATE_RESOURCE_GROUP = vigor-tfstate-rg
TFSTATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT = vigortfstate1748797860
POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD = [from terminal output]
SECRET_KEY = [from terminal output]
ADMIN_EMAIL = mi.vedprakash@gmail.com
```

### Optional AI Provider Keys:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY = [your-gemini-key] (recommended for cost efficiency)
OPENAI_API_KEY = [your-openai-key] (optional)
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY = [your-perplexity-key] (optional)
```

## üéØ What Happens After You Add Secrets

1. **Push any change** to `main` branch
2. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build & test backend + frontend
   - Security scan with CodeQL + Trivy
   - Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
   - Deploy apps to Azure
   - Run health checks

## üìä Expected Results

### Development Environment (~$45-65/month):

- **Backend**: `https://vigor-dev-app-xxxxxxxx-backend.azurewebsites.net`
- **Frontend**: `https://vigor-dev-app-xxxxxxxx-frontend.azurestaticapps.net`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (B_Standard_B1ms)
- **Redis**: Basic cache
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights

### Admin Features:

- AI provider management
- Real-time cost tracking
- Budget enforcement
- Smart provider routing
- Usage analytics

## üîç Monitor Deployment

- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/vedprakash-m/vigor/actions
- **Azure Portal**: https://portal.azure.com
- **Cost Management**: Real-time in admin dashboard

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify all secrets are correctly configured
3. Ensure Azure subscription has sufficient quota
4. Check Terraform state isn't locked

## üéâ Success Indicators

‚úÖ All GitHub Actions steps pass
‚úÖ Health checks return 200 OK
‚úÖ Frontend loads successfully
‚úÖ Admin dashboard accessible at `/admin`
‚úÖ AI providers configured and working

## GitHub Actions Pipeline Setup

### Overview

The GitHub Actions pipeline is designed to automate the CI/CD process for the Vigor project. It includes the following stages:

1. **Linting**:

   - Backend: Uses `black` and `isort`.
   - Frontend: Uses `npm run lint`.

2. **Testing**:

   - Backend: Runs `pytest`.
   - Frontend: Runs `npm test`.

3. **Building**:

   - Backend: Builds a Docker image.
   - Frontend: Builds the production-ready app using Vite.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploys infrastructure using Azure Bicep files.
   - Deploys backend as a containerized app.
   - Deploys frontend to Azure Storage for static hosting.

### Secrets Configuration

The following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository:

1. **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**: Service principal credentials for Azure login.
2. **AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP**: Name of the Azure resource group.
3. **AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT**: Name of the Azure storage account.

### Next Steps

1. Test the pipeline by pushing changes to the `main` branch.
2. Monitor the pipeline runs in the GitHub Actions tab.
3. Address any issues or errors that arise during the pipeline execution.

### Enhancements to CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Branch-Based Deployment Rules**:

   - The pipeline now deploys only from the `main` branch.

2. **Error Handling**:

   - Added error handling to the deployment steps to ensure graceful failure and rollback if any step fails.

3. **Dependency Caching**:

   - Implemented caching for `npm` and `pip` dependencies to speed up the pipeline.

4. **Separate Jobs**:

   - Backend and frontend jobs are now separated for better modularity and parallel execution.

5. **Secrets Management**:
   - Integrated GitHub Secrets for secure handling of Azure credentials and other sensitive information.

### Future Enhancements

1. Add branch-based deployment rules.
2. Separate jobs for backend and frontend.
3. Implement dependency caching for `npm` and `pip`.
4. Add error handling and rollback strategies.
5. Create preview environments for PR testing.
