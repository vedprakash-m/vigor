# CI/CD Improvement Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Vigor project's CI/CD pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### 1. Local Development Environment

- **Docker Compose setup** for running the full stack locally
- **Pre-push hooks** to prevent pushing broken code to the remote repository
- **Comprehensive pre-commit checks** for code quality and security

### 2. Enhanced Testing

- **End-to-End testing** with Playwright
- **Stricter quality checks** (no more continue-on-error in CI)
- **Unified test coverage reporting** across frontend and backend

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline

- **Frontend CI workflow** to match the backend CI
- **E2E test workflow** to validate integration between components
- **Unified deployment process** with proper environment separation
- **Health checks and smoke tests** for validation after deployment

### 4. Security Improvements

- **Enhanced secret scanning** in pre-commit hooks
- **Dependency security** verification
- **Automated code quality checks** to enforce best practices

## 🧪 Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Start local development environment
./scripts/local-dev.sh start

# Run all tests locally
./scripts/local-dev.sh test-all

# Verify local environment
./scripts/local-dev.sh verify

# Stop local environment
./scripts/local-dev.sh stop
```

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflow

1. **Pre-Commit**: Code quality and security checks
2. **Pre-Push**: Test suite execution to catch issues early
3. **PR Validation**: CI workflows for backend and frontend
4. **Integration Testing**: E2E tests on merged code
5. **Deployment**: Proper staging and production pipelines with verification

## 📈 Expected Outcomes

1. **Higher Code Quality**: Zero failed tests on main branch, >80% test coverage
2. **Faster, Reliable Deployments**: <5 minute deployment time, >99% success rate
3. **Better Developer Experience**: Local environment matches production
4. **Enhanced Security**: No secrets in codebase, regular dependency scanning

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Install git hooks:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-git-hooks.sh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

3. Install Playwright for E2E tests:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npx playwright install
   ```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Expand test coverage to reach at least 80%
2. Further automate performance testing
3. Add canary deployments for safer production releases
