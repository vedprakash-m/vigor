## Executive Summary

### The Uncomfortable Truth

Every fitness app operates on a broken assumption:

> _"Give people better workouts and they'll get fit."_

**This is wrong.**

People don't fail because they lack workouts. YouTube has infinite free workouts. ChatGPT generates perfect programs. The information problem was solved a decade ago.

**People fail because life is designed to make them fail.**

### The Deeper Truth

Most "solutions" just add more work. They ask you to:

- Log every meal
- Rate your sleep
- Check in every morning
- Track your sets and reps

They promise to be invisible, then demand your attention constantly. **That's a lie dressed as a feature.**

### The Insight

The best fitness app is one you never have to think about—and never have to touch.

### Vigor's Answer

**Vigor is not a fitness app. Vigor is a ghost.**

A ghost that watches over you. Knows when you're weak. Knows when you're strong. Whispers exactly what you need to do to survive the modern world.

You don't use Vigor. Vigor uses the data you already generate—your calendar, your sleep, your movement—to make fitness _inevitable_.

**What we're really selling:** Not workouts. Not tracking. Not motivation. We're selling **Executive Function as a Service**—the outsourcing of willpower to a system that never gets tired.

**Our market:** Not "people who want abs." It's **high-performers who cannot afford to be tired.** We sell them time and energy, not squats.

**The measure of our success: How often you forget we exist, yet still get fitter.**

---

## 1. Product Vision

### 1.1 Vision Statement

**Fitness without friction.**

You don't configure Vigor. You don't feed it. You don't check in with it. Vigor feeds on data you already create—and whispers back exactly what you need.

### 1.2 The Three Laws of Vigor

1. **Never ask what can be sensed.** If the phone knows you slept poorly, don't ask. If the calendar shows back-to-back meetings, don't suggest a workout.

2. **Magic in five minutes, but humble confidence.** The first insight must arrive before the first workout—but always with honesty: _"Based on the data I have access to..."_ Never claim omniscience. Leave room for the data being incomplete.

3. **One decision, not ten.** When Vigor speaks, the answer is Yes or No. Never "open the app to learn more."

### 1.3 The Trust Accrual Ladder

**Invisibility is the end state, not the starting state.**

We must earn authority before we take it. Users don't trust invisible systems with their bodies until authority is earned explicitly.

| Phase | Name               | Behavior                                                                         | User Control              | Unlocks After                   |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Observer**       | Ghost watches and suggests. All actions require explicit approval.               | Full control              | Day 1                           |
| 2     | **Scheduler**      | Ghost proposes calendar blocks with preview. User confirms before blocks appear. | Approval required         | 7 days + 3 accepted suggestions |
| 3     | **Auto-Scheduler** | Ghost adds calendar blocks automatically. User can undo.                         | Undo available            | 14 days + 5 completed workouts  |
| 4     | **Transformer**    | Ghost auto-adjusts blocks based on real-time data (Heavy → Recovery).            | Revert available          | 30 days + trust score >80%      |
| 5     | **Full Ghost**     | Complete autonomy. Calendar transforms silently. User rarely intervenes.         | Override always available | 60 days + trust score >90%      |

**Trust Score Factors:**

- Ghost suggestions accepted vs. rejected
- Workout completions after Ghost scheduling
- User overrides (high override rate = slow trust accrual)
- Data consistency (wear Watch consistently = faster trust)

**The Golden Rule:** Users can always see their current phase and manually advance or retreat. The Ghost never takes authority—it's granted.

### 1.4 The Reframe

| What Other Apps Do                    | What Vigor Does                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "Log your workout"                    | Detect the workout. Confirm with one tap.            |
| "How did you sleep?"                  | Import sleep data. Never ask.                        |
| "Here are 500 exercises to browse"    | "Do this. Trust me."                                 |
| "Rate your energy (1-10)"             | Infer energy from sleep + calendar + history.        |
| Notification: "Time for your workout" | Silent calendar block appears in your only free gap. |

### 1.5 Success Metrics

| Metric                  | Target                    | Why It Matters                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Time to First Magic** | < 5 minutes               | User knows this is different immediately  |
| **Weekly Active Rate**  | 80%+                      | Users engaging without being reminded     |
| **Proactive Sessions**  | 60%+ of workouts          | Vigor drives behavior, not user willpower |

## 2. Strategic Differentiation

### 2.1 The Competitive Landscape Problem

Every fitness app offers the same thing—and demands the same thing in return:

| Capability                    | ChatGPT | Fitbod | Apple Fitness+ | Vigor  |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ------ | -------------- | ------ |
| Generate workouts             | ✅      | ✅     | ❌             | ✅     |
| Remember your profile         | ✅      | ✅     | ✅             | ✅     |
| Track workouts                | ❌      | ✅     | ✅             | ✅     |
| **Requires manual input**     | ✅      | ✅     | ✅             | **❌** |
| **Knows your patterns**       | ❌      | ❌     | ❌             | **✅** |
| **Proactively reaches out**   | ❌      | ❌     | ❌             | **✅** |
| **Works while you ignore it** | ❌      | ❌     | ❌             | **✅** |

**The gap:** Every product demands labor. Vigor demands nothing.

### 2.2 Vigor's Unfair Advantages

#### Advantage 1: Ambient Intelligence

Vigor doesn't ask. Vigor observes. It translates data you already create into action you don't have to decide.

| What Others Ask           | What Vigor Knows (Without Asking)                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| "How did you sleep?"      | HealthKit says 5h 12m. RHR elevated. Poor recovery.  |
| "How's your energy?"      | Calendar: 4 meetings before noon. Energy: depleted.  |
| "Did you work out?"       | Detected 34-minute activity spike. Confirm? [Yes/No] |
| "What's your goal today?" | Last leg day: 4 days ago. Today = legs.              |

**The magic:** When you open Vigor (if you open it), everything is already there. Nothing to enter.

#### Advantage 2: Instant Phenome (Day 1 Magic)

Other apps need 60 days to know you. Vigor needs 60 seconds.

**On first launch:**

1. Import 90 days of HealthKit/Google Health data (with permission)
2. Scan calendar patterns (meeting density, typical free blocks)
3. Immediately surface one insight:

> _"I see you haven't worked out consistently since November. When you do exercise, your heart rate recovers slowly—you're deconditioned. Today: 15-minute walk. Tomorrow: we rebuild."_

**No waiting. No earning insights. Magic on contact.**

#### Advantage 3: The Silent Calendar

Other apps send notifications. Vigor sends calendar invites.

- See a 45-minute gap at 6 PM? A "Training Block" appears.
- Stressful day with 6 hours of meetings? A "Recovery Walk" appears at 5:30 PM.
- You slept 4 hours? Nothing appears. Radio silence.

**The app that blocks time beats the app that begs for attention.**

#### Advantage 4: The Data Flywheel

Every day of passive data makes Vigor smarter:

```
More sensor data → Better patterns → Better predictions →
Better outcomes → More trust → More permissions granted
```

After 90 days, leaving Vigor means abandoning insights no other app can replicate.

### 2.3 What Makes This a Blue Ocean

| Red Ocean (Everyone Else)  | Blue Ocean (Vigor)                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Compete on workout quality | Compete on invisibility              |
| App you must open          | Ghost that works while you ignore it |
| Asks for your data         | Translates data you already create   |
| Notifications that nag     | Calendar blocks that appear silently |
| Magic after 60 days        | Magic in 5 minutes                   |
| Exercise library to browse | Single command: "Do this. Trust me." |

### 2.4 The Economic Moat

**Zero cost to get IN. Infinite cost to get OUT.**

- **Day 1:** Vigor imports your historical data. Immediately useful.
- **Day 90:** Vigor has learned your patterns, your recovery needs, your skip predictors.
- **Switching Cost:** Leaving means starting over. No competitor can import your Phenome.

**What We're Selling (And How to Price It):**

Do not price Vigor against Fitbod ($12.99) or MyFitnessPal ($19.99).

Price it against:

- **A personal trainer:** $100+/hour
- **Burnout recovery:** Priceless
- **Executive function:** The scarcest resource in modern life

If you charge $9.99, users treat it like a utility they'll cancel when money gets tight.
If you charge $49/month (or $499/year), users treat it like an executive assistant they can't live without.

**The Psychology of Price:** High price forces respect. When you pay $50/month, you listen when the calendar says "Sleep." When you pay $9.99, you ignore it.

**Vigor is Health Assurance.** Not a fitness app subscription.

### 2.5 Platform Strategy: Apple Watch Required

**The zero-friction Ghost requires ecosystem integration that only Apple provides:**

- HealthKit (sleep, HRV, workouts, heart rate)
- Calendar (native integration, not OAuth flows)
- Focus Modes (respect Do Not Disturb)
- Watch complications (the Ghost on your wrist)
- Shortcuts/Siri (voice triggers for Ghost Operations)

**Our position:** Vigor requires Apple Watch. Not iPhone-only. Not "works better with Watch." **Required.**

A phone in a pocket cannot measure the soul of a workout. It creates bad data. Bad data leads to bad recommendations. Bad recommendations break trust. A degraded Ghost is worse than no Ghost.

**The Marketing Angle:** "The first app smart enough to require Apple Watch." Make the hardware a prerequisite for the magic. This signals exclusivity and ensures data fidelity.

**Android:** Future consideration only after the Apple experience is flawless. No degraded modes. Ever.

## 3. How Vigor Knows What You Need

### 3.1 The Hierarchy of Data (Zero Friction First)

Vigor prioritizes data sources by friction cost:

| Priority | Source                  | Friction    | What We Learn                           |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Apple Watch + HealthKit | Zero        | Sleep, steps, HRV, workouts, heart rate |
| 2        | Calendar (read-only)    | Zero        | Free blocks, meeting density, patterns  |
| 3        | Location (optional)     | Zero        | At gym? At home? Traveling?             |
| 4        | One-tap confirms        | Minimal     | "Workout logged. Tap if wrong."         |
| 5        | Manual logging          | Last resort | Only when Watch sensors fail (rare)     |

**The Rule:** Never ask what can be sensed. Never sense what isn't needed.

### 3.2 Day 1: The Cold Start (Instant Magic)

Most apps are useless on Day 1. Vigor is magic on Day 1.

**Onboarding Flow (< 2 minutes):**

1. **Connect Health Data** — "Let me see the last 90 days." (One tap)
2. **Connect Calendar** — "Let me see your schedule." (One tap)
3. **Basic Profile** — Equipment access, any injuries. (30 seconds)

**Immediate Output:**

> _"Here's what I see:_
>
> - _You averaged 5,400 steps/day last month (sedentary)_
> - _Sleep has been inconsistent—ranging from 4h to 8h_
> - _Your last detected workout was 23 days ago_
> - _Tomorrow you have a gap from 6-7:30 PM_
>
> _My recommendation: A 20-minute movement session tomorrow at 6 PM. I've added it to your calendar. We start slow._"

**No waiting. No data collection period. Value in 60 seconds.**

### 3.3 Passive Data Collection (The Symbiotic Model)

Vigor translates existing data streams into action:

| Data Source           | What We Extract                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HealthKit / GHC**   | Sleep (duration, quality), steps, HRV, resting HR, workouts   |
| **Calendar**          | Meeting count, free blocks, first/last meeting, back-to-backs |
| **Motion/Activity**   | Workout auto-detection, sedentary time                        |
| **Location** (opt-in) | Gym proximity, travel detection                               |

**What we NEVER access:** Meeting content, email, messages, contacts.

### 3.4 The Phenome Engine (Patterns Over Time)

After 30+ days of passive data, patterns emerge:

| Pattern           | How Detected                              | Insight Example                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Sleep-Performance | Correlate sleep duration with workout RPE | "You're 23% weaker after < 6h sleep"   |
| Skip Predictors   | Correlate skips with calendar/sleep data  | "High meetings + low sleep = 80% skip" |
| Recovery Needs    | Time between sessions vs. performance     | "You need 3 days between leg sessions" |
| Optimal Windows   | Time-of-day workout performance           | "You perform 15% better before 10 AM"  |

**These insights surface automatically—no user action required.**

## 4. Feature Requirements

### 4.1 The Interface Principle

**The best interface is no interface.**

Vigor's UI should feel empty most of the time. When you open the app, there's one thing to do—or nothing at all.

### 4.2 Pillar 1: The Single Command

No exercise library. No workout browser. No menus.

**The Interface:**

A single text prompt:

> _"20 minutes. Dumbbells. My shoulder is bothering me."_

**The Response:**

A complete workout, generated instantly, respecting all constraints:

- Time available
- Equipment mentioned
- Injury/limitation stated
- Recent training history (from sensors)
- Recovery status (from sleep data)

**One tap to start. Workout auto-logged as you go.**

### 4.3 Pillar 2: The Ghost Notification

Notifications are cancer. Use them wrong and users delete you.

**The Rules:**

1. **Maximum 1 notification per day.** Ever.
2. **Never ask a question.** Notifications are commands, not surveys.
3. **Binary response only.** "Do this? [Yes/No]"—or just a calendar block with no notification.
4. **Silence is an option.** If sleep < 5 hours, say nothing. They know.

**Examples of Good Notifications:**

| Context                     | Notification                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Free block detected at 6 PM | "Training block added to calendar. Tap to adjust."     |
| Detected workout            | "Workout logged (45 min, moderate). Tap if I'm wrong." |
| 4 days since last session   | "You're due. 15 min session at 6 PM. Tap to skip."     |

**The Passive Acceptance Principle:**

Active confirmation ("Log it? Yes/No") is still one decision too many.
Passive acceptance ("Logged. Tap if wrong.") assumes the Ghost is right.
The user only acts when we're wrong—which should be rare.

**Examples of BAD Notifications (Never Do This):**

- "Good morning! How are you feeling today?"
- "You've been sitting for 2 hours!"
- "How was your workout?"
- "Check out this new feature!"

### 4.4 Pillar 3: The Silent Calendar

The calendar is the interface. Not the app.

**Behavior:**

- Vigor detects free blocks in your day
- A "Training Block" appears automatically in the gap
- No notification needed—it's just _there_
- If you delete it, Vigor learns: "Not a good time"
- If you move it, Vigor learns: "Preferred time"

**Calendar Block Types:**

| Block Type     | Duration  | When Triggered                    |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Training Block | 30-60 min | 2+ days since last workout        |
| Recovery Walk  | 15-20 min | High stress day (6+ meetings)     |
| Movement Break | 10 min    | 3+ hours of back-to-back meetings |
| Rest Day       | N/A       | Poor sleep + recent high volume   |

**The Dynamic Truth:**

Calendar blocks are not static. They transform based on real-time data.

- You scheduled a "Heavy Lifts" block at 6 PM
- At 6 AM, Vigor sees: HRV crashed, sleep was 4.5 hours
- By the time you check your calendar, the block has _already_ changed

**But the Ghost preserves your ego.**

The calendar block now reads:

> **⚠️ Recovery Walk** (Was: Heavy Lifts)
> _"Your HRV is crashed. Heavy lifting today risks injury. Tap to revert."_

The user sees what happened. They understand why. They have agency to override. But the default is protection.

**This is the magic moment.** When users see their calendar transform _before they even thought about it_—and understand why—they become customers for life.

**The Conflict Protocol:**

Calendar management is dangerous. If we schedule over something important, we die.

1. **Never ask "Why?"** — If user rejects a calendar block, accept it silently. No guilt. No questions.
2. **Learn implicit patterns** — If user always rejects 2-4 PM blocks, stop scheduling them—even if the calendar shows "free."
3. **Apologize and vanish** — If a block was wrong: _"Understood. Block removed."_ Nothing more.
4. **Respect the sacred** — Some gaps aren't for fitness. The Ghost learns this through rejections, not interrogation.

**Sacred Time Detection:**

The Ghost must detect and protect sacred time. Heuristics:

| Signal                              | Action                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Block deleted 3+ times at same time | Never schedule that slot again |
| Weekend mornings before 9 AM        | Protected by default           |
| Evening blocks after 8 PM           | Require Phase 4+ trust         |
| Days with "travel" in calendar      | No scheduling                  |
| Religious/cultural holidays         | Auto-protected                 |
| Recurring personal blocks           | Always protected               |
| Lunch blocks (12-1 PM)              | Protected unless user opts in  |

**The Explicit Guarantee:**

> "Vigor will never schedule over existing events. Ever. Only empty gaps. Only when you've granted permission."

### 4.5 Pillar 4: Zero-Input Workout Logging

If the user has to manually log sets and reps, we've failed.

**The Sensor Truth:**

Let's be honest: A phone in a pocket cannot tell the difference between a deadlift and a squat. It cannot count reps accurately if it's sitting on a bench. **The Ghost's magic depends on the fidelity of the sensors.**

**Our Position:**

> _"Vigor works best with Apple Watch or a wearable. Without one, you'll still get smart scheduling—but we can't see your workouts as clearly."_

**With Wearable (Full Ghost Mode):**

1. Watch detects workout automatically (heart rate + motion + workout app)
2. Duration, intensity, and workout type captured
3. User gets one-tap confirmation: "45-min strength session. Log it? [Yes/No]"
4. If Yes → logged with accurate metrics
5. Phenome learns from real data

**Without Wearable (Degraded Mode):**

1. Phone detects likely workout (motion + time patterns)
2. User confirms: "Did you work out around 6 PM? [Yes/No]"
3. If Yes → logged with estimated duration
4. Phenome learns slower, with less precision

**We don't hide this. We explain it.** Mediocrity kills brands. A degraded experience honestly communicated is better than a broken promise.

**Progressive Enhancement:**

| User Type         | Logging Experience                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Wearable + Auto   | One-tap confirm. Full metrics. Done.           |
| Wearable + Detail | Confirm + add exercises/weights (their choice) |
| Phone Only        | Confirm workout happened. Estimated metrics.   |

### 4.6 Pillar 5: The Phenome Dashboard

Your personal patterns, surfaced automatically.

**What Users See (After 30+ Days):**

> **Your Patterns**
>
> - Sleep Impact: You're 23% weaker after less than 6 hours
> - Best Time: Morning workouts outperform evening by 18%
> - Recovery: You need 3 days between leg sessions
> - Skip Risk: High when meetings > 5 and sleep < 6

**Insight Confidence:**

- 🟢 High confidence (60+ data points, consistent signal)
- 🟡 Emerging pattern (30-60 data points, signal stabilizing)
- ⚪ Not enough data yet (observing)

**Sensor Confidence (Internal):**

Every Ghost action has an internal confidence score:

| Action                               | Confidence Required | Override Friction       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Suggest a workout time               | 50%+                | Low (one tap)           |
| Auto-schedule a block                | 70%+                | Medium (undo available) |
| Transform a block (Heavy → Recovery) | 85%+                | Low (revert available)  |
| Cancel a scheduled block             | 90%+                | N/A (protective action) |

**If the Ghost ever feels wrong but stubborn, trust dies permanently.** Every action must be explainable and reversible.

**No gamification. No badges. Just truth about your body.**

### 4.7 Pillar 6: Ghost Operations (Exception Handler)

The Ghost handles your logistics when life breaks the pattern. This is not coaching. This is operations.

**V1 Scope (Ship This):**

- Schedule chaos (meetings exploded, need to reschedule)
- Sleep disruption (adjust intensity based on recovery)
- Travel time zone shifts (pause/resume scheduling)

**V2+ Scope (Later):**

- Facility detection (hotel gym equipment)
- Training for specific events (5K, marathon)
- Injury rehab protocols
- Equipment inventory awareness

**The Rule:** Scope creep kills. V1 Ghost Operations handles chaos, not complexity.

**When Ghost Operations Activates:**

- "My schedule is chaos this week"
- "I slept terribly, adjust today"
- "I'm traveling to Denver" → Ghost pauses auto-scheduling, suggests manual blocks

**When Ghost Operations Should NOT Be Needed:**

If users regularly ask "What should I do today?", the Ghost has failed. The calendar should already have the answer.

**Context Automatically Included:**

- Last 7 days of detected activity
- Sleep patterns this week
- Calendar density today
- Known phenome patterns
- Injury/limitation history
- Location data (hotel amenities, gym proximity)

**Example Interaction (Exception Case):**

User: _"I'm at the Hyatt in Denver for 3 days."_

Ghost: _"Hyatt Denver has a fitness center with dumbbells up to 50 lbs and a Peloton. I've replaced your scheduled barbell work with 2 dumbbell sessions and a spin class. First session: tomorrow 6:30 AM before your 8 AM meeting. Already on your calendar."_

**Ghost Operations is the logistics layer, not a chatbot.**

### 4.8 Pillar 7: The Human Override

Humans are irrational. Sometimes they want to destroy themselves. Sometimes they want to run until they vomit, even if HRV is crashed. Sometimes they want pizza and sleep, even with a "Training Block" scheduled.

**The Ghost is not a prison warden.**

**When Users Rebel:**

User: _"I'm doing the heavy lift anyway."_

Ghost: _"Understood. I've adjusted tomorrow to prioritize recovery—lighter session, earlier bedtime reminder. You've got this."_

**The Principles:**

1. **Never argue.** The user is always right about their own body in the moment.
2. **Manage the aftermath.** If they defy the plan, quietly adjust the next 48 hours to absorb the stress.
3. **No guilt.** Never say "I told you so." Never track "compliance scores."
4. **Celebrate agency.** Sometimes breaking the plan is the right call. The Ghost doesn't know everything.

**The Ghost exists to serve, not to control.** When defied, it adapts gracefully.

### 4.9 Pillar 8: The Red Button (Emergency Protocol)

High performers have crises. Panic attacks. Ten minutes before a board meeting. Burnout spirals.

**The Ghost becomes a paramedic.**

**Siri Shortcut Integration:**

> User: "Hey Siri, I'm crashing."
>
> Ghost: _"I've cleared the next 15 minutes. NSDR session queued. Breathe."_

**What Happens:**

1. Immediately blocks 10-15 minutes on calendar as "Focus Time"
2. Launches guided NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) or Box Breathing
3. Silences all notifications for the duration
4. Logs the event privately for pattern detection

**Future Pattern Detection:**

After multiple "crashing" events, the Ghost notices patterns:

> _"Your crashes cluster around Thursday afternoons after all-hands meetings. I've added a 10-minute buffer after those meetings for the next month."_

**The Ghost doesn't just help you recover. It prevents the next crisis.**

## 5. User Journeys

### 5.1 Day 1: Absolution, Then Magic

**Time: < 3 minutes total**

1. User downloads app, signs in
2. **Permission Request 1:** "Connect Health Data" — One tap
3. **Permission Request 2:** "Connect Calendar" — One tap
4. **Quick Profile:** Equipment access, injuries (30 seconds)
5. **The Absolution Moment:**

> _"I've looked at your last 90 days. Here's what I see:_
>
> - _Your schedule has been impossible. Back-to-back meetings 4 days a week._
> - _Your sleep has been inconsistent—ranging from 4 to 8 hours._
> - _You tried to work out, but life kept winning._
>
> **It wasn't your fault you fell off.**
>
> _Your schedule was designed to make you fail. Most people blame themselves. The truth is: you never had a chance._
>
> _That changes now. I've found one window this week where you can actually succeed: Tomorrow, 5:30-6:15 PM. It's already on your calendar._
>
> _We start simple. We start winnable."_

6. Calendar block appears. User closes app.
7. **User's reaction:** Not just "That was fast." But: "Someone finally _gets it_."

### 5.2 Day 7: The Ghost Works + The Sunday Truth

1. User opens app once this week (curiosity, not necessity)
2. Sees: 3 workouts logged automatically (one-tap confirmed)
3. Sees: Tomorrow's calendar already has a training block

**Sunday Evening: The Value Receipt arrives.**

Not a notification. A **digital artifact.**

A card that fades in, breathes, shows what the Ghost did for you, then vanishes. No action required. Pure proof of value.

> **Your Week with Vigor**
>
> ✓ 3 workouts completed (2 you almost skipped)
>
> **Decisions Made For You:**
>
> - Tuesday: Rescheduled your HIIT session. HRV indicated elevated strain risk.
> - Thursday: Moved your workout to 7 AM when your afternoon filled up.
> - Friday: Adjusted "Heavy Legs" to "Recovery Walk" based on 4-hour sleep.
>
> **Risk Signals Detected:**
>
> - Tuesday: Elevated injury risk (HRV 23% below baseline)
> - Friday: High skip probability (87% based on your patterns)
>
> **Your Phenome This Week:**
>
> - Resting heart rate: Down 2 bpm
> - Recovery trend: Improving
> - Morning sessions outperforming evening by 22%
>
> **The Ghost earned its keep.**

**Language Rules for Value Receipt:**

| Never Say                | Always Say                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| "Prevented an injury"    | "Elevated injury risk detected"    |
| "You would have skipped" | "High skip probability (X%)"       |
| "Saved you from burnout" | "Strain accumulation was elevated" |
| "We fixed your workout"  | "Adjusted based on recovery data"  |

**Probabilistic language protects us legally and builds trust.** Counterfactuals feel like guesses. Data feels like truth.

**Why this matters:** The Value Receipt doesn't just list what happened—it **quantifies the problems that didn't happen.** This is how you justify a premium price for an invisible product. Users must understand: _"I am healthy today because of decisions I didn't have to make."_

**The Shareable Truth:**

The Value Receipt is our marketing engine. Make it beautiful. Make it shareable.

> "Vigor saved me from 2 potential injuries and reclaimed 4 hours of decision-making this week."

One-tap share to social. No ads needed. This is how we grow.

**User's realization:** "I haven't thought about fitness once. But I've worked out 3 times. And the app _saved_ me from decisions I would have gotten wrong."

### 5.3 Day 30: Patterns Emerge

1. Phenome Dashboard unlocks
2. User sees their first real insights:
   - "You skip 73% of planned workouts when sleep < 6h"
   - "Your best sessions are Tuesday and Thursday mornings"
   - "You need 72 hours between leg-heavy sessions"

3. Vigor now pre-adjusts: After a bad night's sleep, the calendar block disappears. No nagging.

**User's reaction:** "It knows me better than my trainer did."

### 5.4 Day 90: Invisible

1. User rarely opens the app
2. Calendar blocks just appear when appropriate
3. One-tap workout confirmations happen 2-3x per week
4. User is measurably fitter (steps up, consistency up, sleep improving)
5. User recommends Vigor to a friend: _"It's weird—I barely use it, but I'm in the best shape of my life."_

**Success metric achieved:** The app succeeded by becoming invisible.

## 6. Data & Privacy

### 6.1 The Symbiotic Model Requires Trust

Vigor sees more than other apps. That demands more respect.

### 6.2 On-Device Processing (The Ghost Lives Locally)

**Your identifiable patterns live on your device. We use anonymized aggregates to improve the system.**

In the age of surveillance capitalism, "we see everything" is terrifying. Our answer:

- **On-device:** Pattern detection, Phenome storage, all personal correlations
- **Server (anonymized):** ML model updates, aggregate pattern research, bug fixes
- **Never transmitted:** Raw health data, calendar details, location history

**The Reality:**

ML models need updates. Bug fixes require telemetry. Pretending "everything is on-device" will backfire when reality drifts. Instead, we're explicit:

> "Your Phenome lives on your device. We improve our models using anonymized, aggregated patterns—never your personal data."

Clarity beats absolutism. Users respect honesty more than impossible promises.

### 6.3 The Vigor Data Contract

| Commitment                  | What It Means                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **We never see content**    | Calendar: only time blocks. Never titles, attendees, details. |
| **Your data stays yours**   | Full export anytime. Full delete anytime.                     |
| **No selling. Ever.**       | Not to advertisers. Not to insurers. Not to anyone.           |
| **Minimum viable data**     | We only store what makes you fitter. Nothing more.            |
| **Transparency by default** | See exactly what we know about you, anytime.                  |

### 6.4 Permission Tiers

Vigor requires Apple Watch. Beyond that, more permissions = better Ghost.

| Permission Level      | Experience                                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Watch + Health + Cal  | Full Ghost mode: auto-detection, silent scheduling |
| Watch + Health only   | Good recommendations, manual scheduling            |
| Watch + Calendar only | Smart scheduling, but limited workout detection    |

**We never lock features behind permissions. We just explain what's lost.**

## 7. Success Definition

### 7.1 The Ultimate Measure

> **"How many users get fitter while forgetting we exist?"**

If we achieve that, we don't compete with fitness apps. We become infrastructure for human performance.

### 7.2 The Metrics That Matter

| Metric                       | Target  | What It Proves               |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Time to First Insight**    | < 5 min | Magic on contact             |
| **Zero-Input Workouts**      | 50%+    | The ghost is working         |
| **App Opens / Week**         | < 3     | Invisible = successful       |
| **Value Receipt Open Rate**  | 70%+    | Users want proof of value    |
| **30-Day Retention**         | 50%+    | Real value delivered         |
| **90-Day Retention**         | 35%+    | Habit changed                |
| **Referral Rate**            | 40%+    | Users evangelize             |
| **Dynamic Block Engagement** | 80%+    | Users trust auto-adjustments |

### 7.3 Anti-Metrics (What We Avoid)

| Anti-Metric              | Why It's Bad                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Daily Active Users (DAU) | We don't want daily opens. We want daily fitness.            |
| Time in App              | More time = more friction. Less time = better ghost.         |
| Notification Tap Rate    | High tap rate means we're nagging, not helping.              |
| Feature Usage Breadth    | We want depth on core features, not exploration of features. |

## 8. Failure Modes & Graceful Degradation

**Great products define graceful failure.**

### 8.1 When Things Go Wrong

| Failure                            | User Experience                | Ghost Behavior                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Watch battery dies**             | Workout detection fails        | "I couldn't see your workout. Did you train today?" (manual fallback)                              |
| **Data seems wrong**               | HRV spike detected incorrectly | Show confidence: "Your HRV looks unusual. Is this accurate?"                                       |
| **Calendar access revoked**        | Can't schedule blocks          | Degrade gracefully: "I can't see your calendar. Here are my suggestions."                          |
| **User ignores Ghost for 3 weeks** | No engagement                  | After 2 weeks of silence: one gentle check-in. After 4 weeks: reduce to weekly Value Receipt only. |
| **User gets injured**              | Physical harm occurred         | Never claim we "could have prevented" it. Offer: "I've adjusted your plan for recovery."           |
| **Ghost suggestion was wrong**     | User rejected aggressively     | Log the rejection, lower confidence for that pattern, show: "Understood. I'm learning."            |

### 8.2 Ghost Decision Transparency

Users should always be able to ask: **"Why did this happen?"**

Every Ghost action is logged with:

- What triggered it (data signal)
- Confidence level at decision time
- Alternative options considered

**User-visible log:**

> "🔄 Changed 'Heavy Lifts' → 'Recovery Walk'"
> "Reason: HRV 23% below your baseline. Sleep: 4.2 hours. Confidence: 87%."
> "Tap to revert."

### 8.3 Legal & Regulatory Awareness

**What We Are:**

- A fitness scheduling and logging tool
- A pattern recognition system
- An executive function assistant

**What We Are NOT:**

- A medical device
- A diagnostic tool
- A treatment recommendation system

**Language Discipline:**

| Never Say                     | Always Say                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "You're at risk of injury"    | "Elevated strain detected"     |
| "You need recovery"           | "Recovery day suggested"       |
| "Your heart rate is abnormal" | "Heart rate variance detected" |
| "You should see a doctor"     | Never. Not our role.           |

**Disclaimer (visible in app):**

> "Vigor provides fitness scheduling based on patterns in your data. It is not a medical device and does not provide health diagnoses or treatment recommendations. Consult a healthcare provider for medical concerns."

## 9. Appendix: Glossary

### Core Concepts

**The Ghost**: Vigor's operational mode—working in the background, making fitness happen without user attention. Success is measured by how invisible it becomes.

**Ambient Intelligence**: Data collection strategy where Vigor translates information you already generate (health sensors, calendar) into action—without asking for new input. Symbiotic, not parasitic: we give back more than we take.

**Day 1 Magic**: The requirement that Vigor delivers a meaningful, personalized insight within 5 minutes of first use—no waiting period, no data collection phase.

**Silent Calendar**: Calendar-as-interface paradigm where Vigor adds/removes workout blocks directly to the user's calendar rather than sending notifications.

**Zero-Input Workout**: A logged workout that required nothing more than a one-tap confirmation from the user.

### Pattern Terms

**Personal Phenome**: The collection of patterns unique to an individual—sleep impact, recovery needs, skip predictors, optimal timing. Discovered automatically from passive data.

**Skip Predictor**: A factor or combination of factors that predict whether a user will skip a planned workout (e.g., sleep < 6h + meetings > 5).

**Cold Start Magic**: Using historical HealthKit/Google Health data to provide immediate insights on Day 1, bypassing the traditional "data collection period."

**Ghost Operations**: The exception-handling layer that manages logistics when life breaks the pattern—schedule chaos, sleep disruption, travel. Not a chatbot. Not a coach. A logistics system that adapts your plan without requiring decisions. V1 scope is intentionally limited.

**The Red Button**: Emergency Siri shortcut ("Hey Siri, I'm crashing") that immediately clears time, launches NSDR or breathing exercise, and logs the crisis for pattern detection. The Ghost as paramedic.

**Trust Accrual Ladder**: The five-phase progression from Observer (explicit approval required) to Full Ghost (complete autonomy). Authority must be earned, not assumed. Users advance through phases by demonstrating trust via accepted suggestions and completed workouts.

**Sacred Time Detection**: Heuristics that detect and protect time slots that should never be scheduled—weekend mornings, lunch blocks, recurring personal events, religious observances. The Ghost learns these through rejections and explicit signals.

**Sensor Confidence**: Internal scoring system (0-100%) that determines what actions the Ghost can take. Higher confidence required for more autonomous actions (auto-scheduling requires 70%+, block transformation requires 85%+).

### Design Principles

**The One-Button Rule**: Any notification or prompt must be answerable with a single tap (Yes/No). Never "tap to learn more."

**Contextual Silence**: The principle that sometimes the right action is no action—don't suggest workouts after a 4-hour sleep night.

**Radical Passivity**: Design philosophy prioritizing passive data collection over active user input. If you have to ask, you've failed.

**The Value Receipt**: Weekly proof-of-value summary ("The Sunday Truth") that makes the Ghost's invisible work visible—solving the retention paradox where users cancel because they forgot the app helped them.

**Dynamic Truth**: Calendar blocks that automatically transform based on real-time health data (e.g., "Heavy Lifts" becomes "Recovery Walk" when HRV crashes overnight).

### Voice & Tone

**The Vigor voice is: High-end concierge meets cardiologist.**

- **Concise.** Never two sentences when one will do.
- **Precise.** Specific numbers, not vague encouragement.
- **Professional.** Not a friend. Not a buddy. Not a coach.
- **Calm authority.** The Ghost knows. The Ghost doesn't need to prove it.

**Examples:**

| Wrong (Buddy)                                 | Right (Concierge)                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "Great job today! You crushed it! 💪"         | "45 min. 312 kcal. Logged."          |
| "Hey! Looks like you might need rest today!"  | "Recovery day. Light movement only." |
| "Don't forget to hydrate! Water is key! 💧"   | (Silence. The Ghost doesn't nag.)    |
| "I noticed you skipped yesterday—no worries!" | "Block moved to tomorrow."           |

**The Ghost is not your friend. It's your infrastructure.** Friends need maintenance. Infrastructure just works.

_"Build me a ghost. A ghost that watches over me, knows when I am weak, knows when I am strong, and whispers exactly what I need to survive the modern world._

_Make it passive. Make it magical. Make it so I never have to touch the screen unless I am thanking it."_
