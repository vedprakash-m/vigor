## Executive Summary

**Vigor** is a modern AI-powered fitness platform that addresses the critical gap between expensive personal trainers ($50-100/session) and generic fitness apps that lack personalization. With 73% of people citing lack of professional guidance and 68% citing time constraints as barriers to consistent exercise, Vigor democratizes access to professional-grade fitness coaching through AI technology.

**The Market Problem:** Existing fitness apps offer static content or basic customization (Nike Training Club, Fitbit Coach), while AI-powered alternatives depend on single providers creating reliability risks and cost $60-80/year. Traditional personal training is prohibitively expensive for regular use, creating a significant market gap for accessible, intelligent fitness guidance.

**Vigor's Solution:** Single-provider AI (Gemini Flash 2.5) ensures reliability and cost efficiency, conversational coaching provides real-time form guidance and motivation, and serverless infrastructure (≤$50/month operational budget ceiling, with automatic scaling) enables professional-grade features at consumer prices. The platform combines reliability, personalization, and affordability in a single solution.

Vigor's streamlined architecture with Gemini Flash 2.5 AI delivers personalized workout generation, intelligent coaching conversations, and comprehensive progress tracking while maintaining industry-leading reliability and cost efficiency through Azure Functions and Cosmos DB.
