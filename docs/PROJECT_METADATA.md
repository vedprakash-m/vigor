      "priority": 4,
      "provider": "gpt-4o",
      "enabled": false,
      "cost": "$2.50/$10.00 per 1M tokens"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Automatic Fallback Flow:**

1. User makes AI request (chat, workout generation)
2. System attempts Priority 1 provider (Gemini Flash 2.5)
3. If failure/timeout: automatically tries Priority 2 (Perplexity)
4. If failure: tries Priority 3 (GPT-4o Mini)
5. If all fail: returns built-in fallback response
6. All attempts logged with costs and performance metrics

**Budget Enforcement:**

- Weekly budget: $10.00 (default)
- Monthly budget: $30.00 (default)
- Alert threshold: 80% usage
- Auto-disable: Stops AI requests when budget exceeded
- Real-time cost tracking per request and provider

### 10.2.1 CI/CD Pipeline Complete Resolution (December 6, 2024) - Critical Milestone

**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Enterprise-Grade CI/CD Pipeline Fully Operational**

After comprehensive troubleshooting and systematic resolution, the Vigor project's CI/CD pipeline has achieved full operational status. This represents a critical milestone in transitioning from development to production-ready infrastructure.

#### Complete Issue Resolution & Modern Implementation ✅

**1. Frontend Test Configuration Breakthrough:**

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Jest ES modules compatibility issues with CommonJS configuration causing complete test suite failures
- **Critical Issue**: Duplicate `babel.config.js` file conflicting with `babel.config.cjs` causing compilation errors
- **Complex Dependency Chain**: JSX compilation failing due to missing TypeScript JSX configuration and incompatible babel-jest versions
- **Comprehensive Solution Applied**:
  - **File System Cleanup**: Removed duplicate `babel.config.js`, retained `babel.config.cjs` as authoritative configuration
  - **TypeScript JSX Fix**: Added `jsx: "react-jsx"` to `tsconfig.jest.json` for proper React 18 JSX compilation
  - **Dependency Alignment**: Downgraded babel-jest and jest-environment-jsdom from unstable beta to stable versions
  - **Node.js Version Sync**: Aligned CI/CD pipeline to Node.js v22 matching local development environment
  - **Coverage Configuration**: Excluded `import.meta.env` usage files from coverage to prevent ES module compilation conflicts
- **Verification Success**: Complete frontend test suite now passes with `npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false`
- **Long-term Impact**: Established reliable frontend testing foundation for continuous development

**2. Backend Code Quality Standardization:**

- **Systematic Issue**: 25+ Python files violating PEP8 import sorting standards across entire backend codebase
- **Quality Gate Blocking**: isort failures preventing deployment pipeline progression
- **Files Systematically Fixed**:
  - Core API routes: `auth.py`, `admin.py`, `users.py`, `workouts.py`, `ai.py`, `llm_orchestration.py`
  - Business services: `usage_tracking.py`, `auth.py`, `ai.py`
  - Infrastructure: `main.py`, database models, LLM orchestration modules
  - Administrative tools and utilities across 13 additional backend modules
- **Automated Resolution**: Applied `python -m isort backend/` for consistent, automated formatting
- **Code Quality Enhancement**: All backend Python files now comply with industry-standard import organization
- **Prevention Strategy**: Pre-commit hooks configured to maintain standards and prevent regression

**3. Azure Infrastructure Authentication Modernization:**

- **Legacy Security Issue**: Deprecated `creds` parameter authentication causing "Missing client-id and tenant-id" failures
- **Security Architecture Update**: Complete transition from service principal JSON credentials to modern federated identity
- **Implementation Changes**:

  ```yaml
  # BEFORE - Deprecated & Less Secure
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

  # AFTER - Modern Federated Identity
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
  ```

- **Security Enhancement**: Eliminated long-lived service principal secrets in favor of short-lived, rotated tokens
- **Deployment Impact**: All environments (development, staging, production) now use enterprise-grade authentication
- **Compliance**: Aligned with Microsoft's recommended security practices for Azure CI/CD integration

**4. GitHub Security Integration & SARIF Upload:**

- **Permission Security Issue**: GitHub Actions lacking `security-events: write` permission for vulnerability scan results
- **Integration Failure**: Trivy security scanner unable to upload SARIF results to GitHub Security dashboard
- **Comprehensive Permission Solution**:
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    security-events: write # SARIF security scan uploads
    actions: read # Workflow metadata access
    id-token: write # Azure federated identity tokens
  ```
- **Security Dashboard Integration**: Trivy vulnerability scans now populate GitHub Security tab for centralized monitoring
- **Compliance Impact**: Full integration with GitHub Advanced Security features and vulnerability tracking

#### Advanced CI/CD Architecture Implementation

**Enterprise-Grade Pipeline Design Decisions:**

**1. Modern Azure Authentication Strategy:**

- **Decision**: Adopt Azure federated identity over service principal JSON credentials

- **Implementation**: Trivy container scanning with SARIF upload, Bandit Python security analysis
- **Business Impact**: Proactive security monitoring reduces security incidents and supports compliance requirements

**3. Automated Code Quality Enforcement:**

- **Decision**: Strict code formatting and import organization standards with automated fixing
- **Technical Rationale**:
  - Consistent code style improves team collaboration and code maintainability
  - Automated fixing reduces developer friction while maintaining quality
  - Pre-commit hooks prevent quality issues from entering the codebase
  - Integration with CI/CD prevents deployment of non-compliant code
- **Implementation**: black, isort, bandit for Python; ESLint, TypeScript for frontend
- **Business Impact**: Higher code quality reduces bugs, improves development velocity, and eases onboarding

**4. Security-First Development Approach:**

- **Decision**: Security scanning integration should be treated as a deployment requirement, not optional
- **Technical Rationale**:
  - Multiple security scanning layers (static analysis, container scanning, dependency scanning)
  - Automated vulnerability detection and remediation
  - Centralized security reporting and compliance tracking
- **Implementation**: Integrated Bandit, Trivy, and CodeQL scans in CI/CD pipeline with SARIF upload
- **Business Impact**: Significantly reduced security vulnerabilities and improved compliance posture

**5. Cost Optimization Strategy:**

- **Decision**: Implement a comprehensive cost optimization strategy for AI and infrastructure usage
- **Technical Rationale**:
  - Efficient resource utilization reduces operational costs and improves profitability
  - Intelligent routing and provider selection minimize AI usage costs
  - Automated budget management prevents unexpected expenses
  - Scalable infrastructure supports growth while controlling costs
- **Implementation**:
  - AI provider cost hierarchy established (Gemini Flash, GPT-4o Mini, Perplexity, GPT-4o)
  - Default admin configuration: Gemini Flash primary, Perplexity backup, $10/week budget
  - Real-time budget controls with auto-disable functionality
- **Business Impact**: Significant cost savings and improved financial predictability

- **Best Practice**: Combine pre-commit hooks with CI/CD enforcement for comprehensive quality control
- **Implementation**: Multiple quality gates (local, PR, deployment) with automated fixing where possible
- **Team Guideline**: Quality standards should be enforced by tooling, not manual review

**4. Security-First Development Approach:**

- **Learning**: Security scanning integration should be treated as a deployment requirement, not optional
- **Best Practice**: Multiple security scanning layers (static analysis, container scanning, dependency scanning)
- **Implementation**: SARIF integration provides centralized security visibility and compliance reporting
- **Team Guideline**: Security vulnerabilities must be resolved before deployment

**5. Cost Optimization in AI Usage:**

- **Learning**: AI provider costs vary significantly; intelligent selection can reduce expenses
- **Best Practice**: Establish a cost-effective provider hierarchy and default to the most economical option
- **Implementation**: Automated provider switching based on availability and cost
- **Team Guideline**: Always consider cost implications when selecting AI providers
