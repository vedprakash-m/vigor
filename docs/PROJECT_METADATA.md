### 7.8 Admin Workflow Patterns

**Admin Access Setup:**

1. Register user with username containing 'admin' (e.g., 'admin123', 'vigor-admin')
2. Access admin panel at `http://localhost:5173/admin`
3. Three main management tabs: AI Providers, Budget Settings, Usage Analytics

**Provider Priority Configuration:**

```json
// Default Configuration Example
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "provider": "gemini-flash-2.5",
      "enabled": true,
      "cost": "$0.075/$0.30 per 1M tokens"
    },
    {
      "priority": 2,
      "provider": "perplexity-llama",
      "enabled": true,
      "cost": "$0.20/$0.20 per 1M tokens"
    },
    {
      "priority": 3,
      "provider": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "enabled": true,
      "cost": "$0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens"
    },
    {
      "priority": 4,
      "provider": "gpt-4o",
      "enabled": false,
      "cost": "$2.50/$10.00 per 1M tokens"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Automatic Fallback Flow:**

1. User makes AI request (chat, workout generation)
2. System attempts Priority 1 provider (Gemini Flash 2.5)
3. If failure/timeout: automatically tries Priority 2 (Perplexity)
4. If failure: tries Priority 3 (GPT-4o Mini)
5. If all fail: returns built-in fallback response
6. All attempts logged with costs and performance metrics

**Budget Enforcement:**

- Weekly budget: $10.00 (default)
- Monthly budget: $30.00 (default)
- Alert threshold: 80% usage
- Auto-disable: Stops AI requests when budget exceeded
- Real-time cost tracking per request and provider

## 8. Critical Business Logic Summary

### 8.1 User Profile & Personalization

- **Profile Data Collection**: Fitness goals, current fitness level, available equipment, injury history, exercise preferences
- **Workout Plan Generation**: LLM-powered personalized workout plans with clear explanations for exercise selections
- **Plan Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment based on user feedback and progress tracking
- **Equipment Consideration**: Plans adapt to user's available equipment and physical limitations

### 8.2 Workout Logging & Progress Tracking

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Sets, reps, weight, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), workout duration
- **Visual Progress**: Graphs, milestones, and historical workout data visualization
- **Workout History**: Complete tracking of user's fitness journey over time
- **Progress Milestones**: Automatic detection and celebration of user achievements

### 8.3 AI Coaching & Motivation

### 8.4 User Tier Management

- **Tier Validation**: All feature access checked against user tier permissions
- **Usage Limits**: AI interactions limited by tier (Basic: 10/day, Premium: 100/day, Enterprise: unlimited)
- **Billing Integration**: Tier changes trigger billing system updates

### 8.5 LLM Orchestration Logic

- **Provider Selection**: Primary provider with automatic fallback to secondary providers
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and system-wide rate limiting for cost control
- **Context Management**: Conversation context maintained across AI interactions

### 8.6 Security Logic

- **JWT Validation**: All protected endpoints validate JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin endpoints require elevated permissions
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive user data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance with data protection regulations
