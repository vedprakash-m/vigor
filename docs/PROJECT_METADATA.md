- **Security Architecture Update**: Complete transition from service principal JSON credentials to modern federated identity
- **Implementation Changes**:

  ```yaml
  # BEFORE - Deprecated & Less Secure
  with:
    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

  # AFTER - Modern Federated Identity
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
  ```

- **Security Enhancement**: Eliminated long-lived service principal secrets in favor of short-lived, rotated tokens
- **Deployment Impact**: All environments (development, staging, production) now use enterprise-grade authentication
- **Compliance**: Aligned with Microsoft's recommended security practices for Azure CI/CD integration
