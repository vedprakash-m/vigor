### 1.6 December 2024 Infrastructure Cost-Optimization Decision

Beginning December 12, 2024 the Vigor team adopted the following changes to further simplify operations and reduce Azure spend:

1. **Single Resource Group** ‚Äì All Azure assets (App Service, Static Web App, PostgreSQL, Redis, Key Vault, Container Registry, etc.) are now deployed into a single, convention-based resource group `vigor-rg` (East US). This eliminates the overhead of multiple RGs (~$0.20/month per RG for diagnostic logs & policies) and makes quota allocation simpler.
2. **Bicep-Only IaC** ‚Äì Terraform modules and remote state were fully removed. Azure Bicep is now the sole IaC language, leveraging native deployment features and OIDC-authenticated GitHub Actions. This removes Terraform state-storage costs (~$5/month) and halves CI/CD deploy time.
3. **Cost-Effective SKUs by Default** ‚Äì Deployment parameters default to:
   ‚Ä¢ App Service Plan **B1** in non-prod environments, **S1** in prod
   ‚Ä¢ PostgreSQL **Burstable B1ms** for dev/test, **GeneralPurpose GP_G4** for prod
   ‚Ä¢ Redis **Basic C0 250 MB** for dev/test, **Standard C1 1 GB** for prod
   These defaults are centrally managed in `infrastructure/bicep/parameters.bicepparam`.

All CI/CD workflows and deployment scripts were updated to reference the new single resource group and Bicep templates (`infrastructure/bicep`).

> üîÑ **Migration impact:** No downtime. All existing resources were moved into `vigor-rg` via `az resource move`, and Terraform state storage was deleted.

## 6. Architecture Transition Documentation

### 6.1 Container to App Service + Functions Migration (June 2025)

#### 6.1.1 Decision Background

**Previous Architecture Challenges:**

- Persistent issues with Azure Container Registry (ACR) in CI/CD pipelines
- Failed deployments due to ACR connectivity and authentication problems
- Higher costs associated with maintaining container infrastructure
- Increased operational complexity for development team

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. **Continue with ACR and fix issues**: Extensive troubleshooting required
2. **Move to GitHub Container Registry**: Simpler but still container-based
3. **App Service + Functions**: More managed with cost benefits

#### 6.1.2 Decision Rationale

The team evaluated options based on:

- **Cost**: App Service + Functions provides 15-30% cost reduction
- **Simplicity**: Eliminates container registry management
- **Operational overhead**: Reduces DevOps maintenance burden
- **Scalability**: Functions provide better auto-scaling for variable workloads

**Decision Date**: June 14, 2025
**Decision Maker**: Engineering and DevOps team

#### 6.1.3 Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Infrastructure Update (Current)**

- Create Azure Function App for AI processing workloads
- Update App Service configuration for direct code deployment
- Establish Static Web App for frontend hosting
- Update Bicep templates and deployment pipeline

**Phase 2: Codebase Adaptation**

- Refactor AI processing code into Azure Functions
- Update frontend build configuration for Static Web Apps
- Modify backend environment configuration
- Update logging and monitoring integration

**Phase 3: Migration & Validation**

- Deploy backend directly to App Service
- Deploy AI Functions
- Deploy frontend to Static Web Apps
- Validate system functionality and performance

**Phase 4: Cleanup & Documentation**

- Remove container-specific configurations
- Update documentation and runbooks
- Optimize CI/CD pipeline for new architecture

#### 6.1.4 Current Status & Issues

**Status**: Phase 2 in progress (June 14, 2025)
**Completed**:

- Initial infrastructure planning
- Created Bicep templates for App Service, Function App, and Static Web App
- Fixed CI/CD pipeline issues:
  - Resolved composite action secret handling
  - Fixed Bicep validation errors
  - Optimized security scanning
- Migrated AI code to Azure Functions:
  - Created shared LLM provider code for Functions
  - Implemented three core AI Functions: GenerateWorkout, AnalyzeWorkout, CoachChat
  - Added proper authentication between services using managed identities
  - Implemented cold start mitigation and performance monitoring

**In Progress**:

- Testing the integration between App Service and Functions
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Comprehensive migration validation

**Issues & Risks**:

- Cold start performance requires monitoring in production
- Authentication between services requires Azure-specific configuration
- Security scanning optimization needs validation
