# CI/CD Optimization Guide

This guide provides strategies to optimize your CI/CD workflows for speed and efficiency, reducing build times and improving developer experience.

## Cache Optimization Strategies

### Node.js Projects

Add these caching strategies to your frontend workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "18"
          cache: "npm" # Enable built-in npm caching
          cache-dependency-path: "frontend/package-lock.json"

      # Additional cache for Next.js/.next folder
      - name: Cache Next.js build
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            frontend/.next/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('frontend/package-lock.json') }}-${{ github.sha }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('frontend/package-lock.json') }}-
            ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-
```

### Python Projects

Add these caching strategies to your backend workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.10"
          cache: "pip" # Enable built-in pip caching
          cache-dependency-path: "backend/requirements.txt"

      # Additional cache for pytest
      - name: Cache pytest
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        with:
          path: |
            .pytest_cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pytest-${{ hashFiles('backend/requirements.txt') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-pytest-
```

## Parallel Execution Strategies

### Matrix Builds

Use matrix builds to run tests in parallel:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test-group: [unit, integration, e2e]
        node-version: [16, 18]
      # Allow some test failures without failing the workflow
      fail-fast: false

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          if [ "${{ matrix.test-group }}" == "unit" ]; then
            npm run test:unit
          elif [ "${{ matrix.test-group }}" == "integration" ]; then
            npm run test:integration
          else
            npm run test:e2e
          fi
```

### Splitting Large Workflows

Break large workflows into smaller ones that run in parallel:

1. **Core CI Workflow**: Linting, unit tests, security scans
2. **Extended Tests Workflow**: Integration and E2E tests
3. **Build Workflow**: Building and publishing artifacts

## Smart Job Dependencies

Use job dependencies to optimize the workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Fast, run first

  unit-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Can run in parallel with lint

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [lint, unit-tests]
    # Only run after lint and unit-tests pass

  integration-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    # Run after build completes
```

## Conditional Job Execution

Only run certain jobs when necessary:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Deploy PR preview

  deploy-production:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Deploy to production
```

## Artifact Optimization

Minimize artifact sizes to speed up uploads/downloads:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build app
        run: npm run build

      - name: Optimize artifacts
        run: |
          # Remove source maps and unnecessary files
          find build -name "*.map" -delete

      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build
          path: build/
          retention-days: 3 # Reduce from default 90 days
```

## Self-hosted Runners for Specialized Workloads

For resource-intensive tasks, consider self-hosted runners:

```yaml
jobs:
  heavy-computation:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
      # Resource-intensive tasks
```

## Monitor and Optimize Workflow Times

Add a workflow to analyze CI/CD performance:

```yaml
name: CI Performance Analysis

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0" # Weekly on Sunday

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Analyze workflow runtimes
        run: |
          # Get average workflow durations for past 100 runs
          gh api /repos/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs \
            --jq '.workflow_runs | group_by(.name) | map({workflow: .[0].name, avg_duration: (map(.updated_at | fromdateiso8601) - map(.created_at | fromdateiso8601) | add / length)}) | sort_by(.avg_duration) | reverse'
```

## Implement these optimizations incrementally and measure the impact on your workflow execution times.

Happy optimizing!
