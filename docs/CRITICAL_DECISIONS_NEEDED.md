# Critical Technical & Business Decisions Needed

## 1. API Design & Standards

### Question: API Architecture Approach

**Options:**

- [ ] RESTful API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] GraphQL for flexible data fetching
- [ ] Hybrid approach (REST for simple operations, GraphQL for complex queries)

**Industry Recommendation:** RESTful API for MVP simplicity, GraphQL consideration for Phase 2

### Question: API Versioning Strategy

**Options:**

- [ ] Implement versioning from start (`/api/v1/`)
- [ ] Add versioning when breaking changes needed
- [ ] Header-based versioning (`Accept: application/vnd.vigor.v1+json`)

**Industry Recommendation:** URL-based versioning from start

### Question: Error Response Format

**Options:**

- [ ] RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs
- [ ] Custom JSON error format
- [ ] Simple error messages with HTTP status codes

**Industry Recommendation:** RFC 7807 for consistency and tooling support

## 2. Authentication & Security

### Question: Social Login Integration

**Options:**

- [ ] MVP: Email/password only
- [ ] MVP: Include Google OAuth
- [ ] MVP: Include Google + Apple OAuth
- [ ] Phase 2: Add social logins

**Industry Recommendation:** Google OAuth in MVP for better UX

### Question: Access Control Model

**Options:**

- [ ] Simple role-based (User, Admin)
- [ ] Tier-based with roles (Basic User, Premium User, Admin, Super Admin)
- [ ] Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

**Industry Recommendation:** Tier-based with roles for fitness app context

### Question: Session Management

**Options:**

- [ ] Short sessions (1 hour) with auto-refresh
- [ ] Medium sessions (24 hours) with manual refresh
- [ ] Long sessions (7 days) with sliding expiration
- [ ] Tier-based session durations

**Industry Recommendation:** Tier-based (Basic: 24h, Premium: 7 days)

---

## 3. Database Strategy

### Question: PostgreSQL Migration Trigger

**Options:**

- [ ] When SQLite file exceeds 1GB
- [ ] When user count reaches 1,000
- [ ] When user count reaches 10,000
- [ ] When deploying to production (regardless of size)

**Industry Recommendation:** Deploy with PostgreSQL from production start

### Question: Data Deletion Policy

**Options:**

- [ ] Hard deletes (permanent removal)
- [ ] Soft deletes (mark as deleted, keep data)
- [ ] Soft deletes with automatic purging after 90 days
- [ ] User choice (immediate or delayed deletion)

**Industry Recommendation:** Soft deletes with GDPR-compliant purging

### Question: Database Schema Management

**Options:**

- [ ] Code-first with automatic migrations
- [ ] Database-first with manual schema design
- [ ] Hybrid: Code-first for development, review migrations for production

**Industry Recommendation:** Code-first with migration review process

---

## 4. Monitoring & Observability

### Question: Monitoring Tool Choice

**Options:**

- [ ] Free tier: Self-hosted Prometheus + Grafana
- [ ] Paid SaaS: Datadog (comprehensive but expensive)
- [ ] Paid SaaS: New Relic (APM focused)
- [ ] Simple: Basic logging + health checks only for MVP

**Budget Consideration:** What's your monthly monitoring budget?

### Question: User Analytics Tracking

**Options:**

- [ ] No user analytics (privacy-first)
- [ ] Basic analytics (page views, feature usage)
- [ ] Detailed analytics (user journeys, A/B testing)
- [ ] Custom analytics with user consent

**Privacy Consideration:** What level of user tracking aligns with your privacy stance?

### Question: Error Tracking

**Options:**

- [ ] Basic console logging
- [ ] Sentry.io for real-time error tracking
- [ ] Custom error reporting system
- [ ] Cloud provider logging (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Logging)

**Industry Recommendation:** Sentry for development productivity

---

## 5. AI/LLM Cost Management

### Question: Monthly LLM Budget (MVP Phase)

**Options:**

- [ ] $100/month (very conservative)
- [ ] $500/month (moderate testing)
- [ ] $1,000/month (robust MVP)
- [ ] $2,000+/month (extensive testing)

**Critical:** This affects user limits and feature availability

### Question: Cost Alert Thresholds

**Options:**

- [ ] Daily: $10, Weekly: $50, Monthly: 80% of budget
- [ ] Weekly: $100, Monthly: 90% of budget
- [ ] Only monthly alerts at 80% and 95%
- [ ] Real-time alerts for unusual spikes

### Question: Cost Limit Behavior

**Options:**

- [ ] Hard limit: Stop AI features when budget exceeded
- [ ] Soft limit: Notify but continue service
- [ ] Tier-based: Free users stopped, paid users continue
- [ ] Graceful degradation: Switch to cheaper models

**Industry Recommendation:** Tier-based limits with graceful degradation

---

## 6. Development Workflow

### Question: Code Review Process

**Options:**

- [ ] All code requires review (even solo development)
- [ ] Review required for main branch merges only
- [ ] Review required for production deployments only
- [ ] No formal review process (rapid development)

**Industry Recommendation:** All main branch merges require review

### Question: Testing Strategy

**Options:**

- [ ] Unit tests only (fast development)
- [ ] Unit + Integration tests (comprehensive)
- [ ] Unit + Integration + E2E tests (maximum coverage)
- [ ] TDD approach (tests first)

**Industry Recommendation:** Unit + Integration for MVP, E2E for critical paths

### Question: Deployment Strategy

**Options:**

- [ ] Manual deployments (full control)
- [ ] Automated deployments on main branch push
- [ ] Automated deployments with manual approval
- [ ] Blue-green deployments (zero downtime)

**Industry Recommendation:** Automated with manual approval for production
