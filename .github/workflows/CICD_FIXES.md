# CI/CD Issues Fixed

## Summary of Changes

The following CI/CD workflow issues have been systematically fixed:

### 1. Structure Issues

- **Fixed root-level workflow files**: The `backend-app-service-job.yml`, `function-app-job.yml`, and `static-web-app-job.yml` files had structural issues with missing workflow definition elements. They were starting with job content directly without proper workflow structure.
- **Added workflow_call event triggers**: Added proper workflow_call event triggers to allow these files to be used as reusable workflows.

### 2. Environment Variable Handling

- **Fixed environment variable references**: Replaced the incorrect references to `${{ env.USE_DIRECT_DEPLOYMENT }}` with direct conditionals where appropriate.
- **Improved secret validation**: Improved the secret validation logic to better handle optional secrets and avoid reference errors.

### 3. GitHub Actions Compatibility

- **Fixed Azure CLI setup**: Updated the Azure CLI setup step to use a more compatible method.
- **Fixed token usage**: Used GitHub token for authentication in the static web app deployment step.

### 4. Workflow Organization

- **Created consolidated workflow file**: Added a `ci_cd_pipeline_combined.yml` that properly integrates all the jobs in a clean, maintainable format.
- **Made job references consistent**: Ensured all job needs/dependencies are consistently named and referenced.

### 5. Error Handling

- **Improved error handling**: Added better error messages and conditional checks throughout the workflows.
- **Added proper continue-on-error flags**: Added continue-on-error flags to non-critical steps to prevent workflow failures on minor issues.

## Files Modified

1. `/backend-app-service-job.yml`
2. `/function-app-job.yml`
3. `/static-web-app-job.yml`
4. `/.github/workflows/ci_cd_pipeline_combined.yml` (new file)
5. `/fix_ci_cd_issues.sh` (script to commit and push changes)

## Next Steps

1. Review the changes and ensure they meet the project's CI/CD requirements
2. Run a test workflow to confirm all jobs execute correctly
3. Update documentation to reflect the new workflow structure
4. Consider removing the duplicate/outdated workflow files after confirming the new combined workflow works correctly
